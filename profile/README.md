# What is Harmonica?

## Presentation

Harmonica (BlockcHain fRaMewOrk for the desigN and Implementation of deCentralized Application) is a semi-automatic framework dedicated to helping practitioners in the design and implementation of Blockchain applications. The framework is composed of two different tools: (1) BLADE (BLockchain Automated Decision Engine), a decision-making tool for the selection of the most suitable blockchain and software patterns in a given case, and (2) BANCO, a configurator capable of assembling parts of the blockchain application to design using core assets (ie. templates), an approach from the Software Product Line (SPL) research field (to come). 
A knowledge base, formalized as an ontology, has also been designed to support the two different tools. The Figure 1 shows a graphical organization of the project:

  <i>Figure 1: Framework organization. Orange artifacts have been implemented in their first version, and red artifacts are in design or development.

Other tools have also been created to support the construction of the knowledge base and artifacts: Ardent, a platform to extract software knowledge during systematic literature studies and identify patterns and connections between software components, and a benchmarking tool for Ethereum smart-contracts. 

If you want to learn more on those, feel free to read the project publications below, or have a look at project repositories!

## Repositories

This organization holds many repositories.
The following artifacts constitutes the framework core:

- [BLADE - A decision-making tool for the selection of a blockchain and software patterns.](https://github.com/harmonica-project/BLADE)
- [BANCO - Generating blockchain applications based on software product line principles (WIP)](https://github.com/harmonica-project/BANCO)
- [A list of blockchain-based software patterns identified during a systematic literature review](https://github.com/harmonica-project/blockchain-patterns-collection)
- [An ontology of blockchain-based software patterns and a tool able to explore it.](https://github.com/harmonica-project/blockchain-patterns-ontology)


Along these contributions, tools have been designed to facilitate the creation of core parts of the framework:
- [Ardent - A platform to assist data extraction and processing of software architectures during systematic literature reviews](https://github.com/harmonica-project/Ardent)
- [An implementation of our blockchain-based pattern for confidential and anonymous contract enforcement](https://github.com/harmonica-project/slc-implementation)
- [A benchmarking tool to evaluate blockchain network performance](https://github.com/harmonica-project/sc-archi-gen)
